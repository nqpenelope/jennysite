<strong>Note: </strong>Information regarding historical organs in Vermont was extracted from the Organ Historical Society (OHS) Pipe Organ Database using a web crawler and some serious data massaging in Excel. Approximate locations were geocoded from database information using MMQGIS, after removing records referring to private residences.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Locations were geocoded by matching general addresses (such as "Unitarian Church, Burlington") to approximate coordinates using geocoding engines, and therefore possess varying accuracy. The OHS Pipe Organ Database is based primarily upon user submissions, and thus may contain duplicate records or unverified information. Interested organ enthusiasts are encouraged to volunteer their time or expertise by contacting the stewards of the database <a href="http://database.organsociety.org/ContactUs.html">here</a>.
